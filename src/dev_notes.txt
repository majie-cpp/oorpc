* Pending issues
===================
$$1. Server side mem leak caused by the ref() of returned value
$$2. exception handling on proxy side.
$$3. Remove IN, OUT semantic
$$4. byte order convertion.
$$5. Crash when running again and again. Cause: should use multithreaded run-time lib.
$$6. Mem leak can be seen.
$$7. Unicode support.
$$8. NULL pointer support
$$9. returned pointer of Non-primitive type
$$10. gcc, VS2005 porting.

$$ means: has been resolved or achieved.


Notes:
======
1. Should use multithreaded run-time lib if thread is used.
2. RTTI option must be supported by the compiler.
3. To compile the source together with MFC:

 * The precompiled headers option must be set to "Automatic use of precompiled headers".
 * The winsock2 supported option must be selected while creating the application. Otherwise the mfc socket initialization code and afxsock.h must be added manually.

4. While working with MFC socket, the socket recv is sometimes hung due to more than 1 recv(..) calling in CSocket::OnReceive(..) handler, which might result in FD_READ event missing. Refer to socket common issue on MSDN: Q185728, Q245434.
To work around this, the MFC socket server use WSAAsyncSelect(..) rather than CSocket to receive asynchronous socket event.

5. WSAAsyncSelect(..) still does not work as expected in case where 2 recv(..) calling are made againest 1 FD_READ message. 
Implemented AsyncSelector to fully resolve this issue: launch a underlying thread to monitor the specified socket, post WND message to the host window whenever any socket event occurs.
